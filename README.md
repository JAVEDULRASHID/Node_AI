        Implementation of an AI Node in Python using the DRAIVE Link Framework
    </h2>
    <p>
        DRAIVE Link is a framework that enables high-performance distributed software systems. It is based on a decentralized, consumer-driven publish-subscribe architecture. For more details about the architecture and system components, refer to the official <a href="https://pages.draive.com/link2/#reactive-mesh-for-realtime-data-processing">documentation</a>. In this project, we will implement a Link Node in Python that uses an object detection AI algorithm as the primary use case.
